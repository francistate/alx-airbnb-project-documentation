# User Stories Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the user stories for the Airbnb Clone backend system, converted from the use case diagram interactions. User stories provide a user-centered approach to defining system requirements and help guide development priorities.

## Files in this Directory
- `user-stories.md` - Complete collection of user stories with acceptance criteria
- `README.md` - This documentation file explaining the user stories approach

## What are User Stories?
User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability. They follow the format:

**"As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."**

User stories help the development team understand:
- **Who** the user is (user type/persona)
- **What** they want to accomplish (functionality)
- **Why** they want it (value/benefit)
