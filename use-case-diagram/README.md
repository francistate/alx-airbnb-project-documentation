# Use Case Diagram - Airbnb Clone Backend

## Overview
This directory contains the use case diagram for the Airbnb Clone backend system, which visualizes the interactions between different actors (users) and the system functionalities. The diagram illustrates how guests, hosts, admins, and automated systems interact with various features of the platform.

## Key Relationships

### Include Relationships
These represent mandatory dependencies between use cases:
- **Make Booking** includes **Make Payment** - Bookings require payment processing
- **Make Booking** includes **Update Availability** - Bookings update property availability
- **Make Payment** includes **Calculate Fees** - Payments require fee calculations
- **Create Listing** includes **Upload Photos** - Property listings require images
- **Approve Bookings** includes **Send Notifications** - Approvals trigger notifications

### Extend Relationships
These represent optional extensions to base use cases:
- **Reset Password** extends **Login/Logout** - Password reset is an optional login feature
- **Cancel Booking** extends **Make Booking** - Cancellation is an optional booking action

## Actor Inheritance
- **Host** inherits all **Guest** capabilities, meaning hosts can also book properties as guests
- This reflects the real-world scenario where property owners may also travel and book accommodations

## External System Dependencies
- **Payment Gateway** - Required for secure payment processing
- **Email Service** - Required for sending notifications and communications

## Business Rules Represented
1. **Authentication Required** - Most use cases require user authentication
2. **Role-based Access** - Different actors have access to different functionalities
3. **Payment Integration** - All booking transactions must include payment processing
4. **Automated Notifications** - System automatically sends notifications for key events
5. **Content Moderation** - Admin oversight for user-generated content

## System Boundaries
The diagram clearly shows the system boundary by distinguishing between:
- **Internal Use Cases** - Functionality provided by the Airbnb Clone system
- **External Actors** - Third-party services that the system depends on
- **User Interactions** - Direct user actions on the platform

## Usage Notes
- This diagram serves as a high-level overview of system functionality
- Each use case represents a complete user goal or system function
- The diagram helps identify required API endpoints and system components
- Use cases will be converted to user stories for development planning

## Next Steps
1. Convert use cases to detailed user stories
2. Define acceptance criteria for each use case
3. Prioritize use cases for development phases
4. Map use cases to specific API endpoints
5. Create detailed sequence diagrams for complex use cases
